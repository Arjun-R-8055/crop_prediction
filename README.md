CROP PREDICTION AND FERTILIZER SUGGESSTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
1. Objective:
Predict the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions.
Recommend the ideal fertilizer for improving crop yield.
2. Data Collection:
Crop dataset: Includes soil type, temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.
Fertilizer dataset: Contains information about various fertilizers, nutrient requirements of crops, and soil deficiencies.
You can source these datasets from agricultural databases or government portals like ICRISAT, Kaggle, or other open-source platforms.

3. Features for Crop Prediction:
Soil Type (pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels)
Rainfall (in mm)
Temperature
Humidity
4. Modeling Approaches:
Classification Algorithms for crop prediction:
Random Forest: Works well for multi-class classification problems like crop prediction.
Decision Tree: Easy to interpret, useful for rule-based recommendations.
SVM: Can be used for accurate crop classification in complex datasets.
Regression Models for yield prediction based on fertilizers.
5. Fertilizer Suggestion System:
Use soil nutrient levels (N, P, K) as input and compare with the crop's nutrient requirement to suggest the right fertilizer.
A rule-based system or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) can be effective for matching the crop's needs with the fertilizer.
6. Steps to Build:
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize features.
Model Training: Train the model using historical data on crop production, weather conditions, and soil properties.
Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for classification tasks.
Deployment: Use a web framework (like Flask/Django) for making predictions and displaying suggestions to users.
7. Technologies to Use:
Python (for ML models)
Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for ML algorithms)
Random Forest classifier
8. Output:
Suggest the best crop for a given input condition.
Provide fertilizer recommendations based on soil analysis.
